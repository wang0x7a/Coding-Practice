/* P0902
 * Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of an X by Y grid. The
 * robot can only move in two directions: right and down. How many possible
 * paths are there for the robot to go from (0, 0) from (X, Y)?
 *
 * Follow up:
 * Imagine a certain spots are "off limits", such that the robot cannot step
 * on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left
 * to the bottom right.
