/* P0910:
 * You have a stack of n boxes, with width w_i, heights h_i, and depths d_i.
 * The boxes cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top of another if
 * each box in the stack is strickly larger than the box above it in width, 
 * height, and depth. Implement a method to build the tallest stack possible, 
 * where the height of a stack is the sum of the heights of each box.
