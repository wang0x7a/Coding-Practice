   // an improved solution:
   // 1) One of the problems of isBalanced above is that, the space complexity
   // is consistently O(lgN), since we need to check from the root.
   // Actually, if a subtree is unbalanced, the whole tree will be as well.
   // Therefore, we could potentially reduce the space complexity by checking
   // if one subtree is balanced, and will return false once we find an
   // unbalanced one.
   // 2) every time we calculate height, the heights of subtrees (subtrees of 
   // subtrees) are repeatedly calculated, we coudl avaoid this redundancy by
   // adding extra variables to record the heights of subtrees.
